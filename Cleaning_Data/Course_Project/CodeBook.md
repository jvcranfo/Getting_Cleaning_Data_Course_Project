#Description

Data downloaded for this assignment was merged using the rbind() function.

Columns with mean and stanard deviation measures are extracted from the 
complete dataset. Columns were then renamed using the features.txt file.

Next, activity names and IDs were taken from the activity_labels.txt
file and inserted into the dataset.

Then column names were corrected.

Finally, a new dataset was produced containing the average for each subject
and activity.

#Variables

y_train, x_train, y_test, x_test, subject_test, subject_train contains
the original data that was downloaded.

ydata, xdata, and subjectdata were merged using the datasets mentioned above. 
These three sets were then merged into 'completedata' which contains all values.

features contains the names for the xdata dataset.  Similarly, the activities
variable contains the names for activities.

Finally, dataaverages.txt contains the averages of all relevant columns (i.e.
having a mean or standard deviation measure).
